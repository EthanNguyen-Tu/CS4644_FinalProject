## How to Use

1. Upon downloading the repository, the three notebooks (CS4644_FinalProject_DatasetSetup.ipynb, CS4644_FinalProject_Models.ipynb, and CS4644_FinalProject_Visualizations.ipynb) should be transferred to Google Drive in a folder called "CS4644_FinalProject".
2. If a different folder is desired, simply change "/CS4644_FinalProject" of 'project_folder = drive_path + "/CS4644_FinalProject"' in the setup sections of the notebooks to the desired folder name.
3. Setup Google Colab to work with [Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api).
4. Run all cells in CS4644_FinalProject_DatasetSetup.ipynb to zip the necessary datasets to your drive.
5. Run all cells in CS4644_FinalProject_Models.ipynb to train and save the models.
6. Run all cells in CS4644_FinalProject_Visualizations.ipynb to visualize the model results.
